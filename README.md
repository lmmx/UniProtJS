# UniProtJS
=========

Accessing Data in online Excel files without any downloading of files or requirement for local software, and providing a list of protein functions from UniProt.

##Easy code for biochemists to use in the browser console

Even though it's very basic, I'm just posting this online for any other life scientists interested in using available datasets often provided online as supplementary files without having to download and process - or even leave the browser.

If you want to customise it be my guest, and I've annotated it to show how you can access other elements from UniProt as well as the function (e.g. associated DOI(s), sequence, keywords, GO annotation etc).
