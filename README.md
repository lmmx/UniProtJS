# UniProtJS
=========

Accessing Data in online Excel files without any downloading of files or requirement for local software, and providing a list of protein functions from UniProt.

##Easy code for biochemists to use in the browser console

I use a Chromebook for lightweight tasks and am interested in how much can be done with 'less' in this sense. The widely used Chrome browser can "run code" in the console, accessed with Ctrl + Shift + J. Notable advantage of this is that anything displayed on the page can be accessed through CSS selectors rather than through text searching etc, and integrating information from other webpages through AJAX requests is far quicker than heading off to each page manually.

Even though it's very basic, I'm just posting this online for any other life scientists interested in using available datasets in the literature, often provided online as supplementary files without having to download and process - or even leave the browser.

If you want to customise it be my guest, and I've commented some lines (with "//") to show how you can access other elements from UniProt as well as the function (e.g. associated DOI(s), sequence, keywords, GO annotation etc).
